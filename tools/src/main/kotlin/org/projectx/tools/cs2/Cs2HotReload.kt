/**
 * Live-reloads clientscripts from source while the editor is running.
 *
 * The chain that makes this work, and the reason each link matters:
 *
 *  - [Cs2HookDispatcher][org.projectx.tools.cs2.vm.Cs2HookDispatcher] builds its
 *    virtual machine once but resolves every hook and every `GOSUB` through
 *    `Cs2Context.script(id)` at dispatch time. Nothing downstream caches the
 *    resolved script - the machine's own state is per-`execute` frames plus the
 *    five global int arrays, neither of which is derived from a script - so
 *    changing what the context returns is genuinely enough to swap bytecode
 *    mid-session. No invalidation call is needed for the VM.
 *  - The replacement is installed into [Cs2Analyzer] rather than kept in this
 *    overlay, because the code generator and the structurer resolve calls through
 *    a context too, and any of them holding the bare analyzer would silently keep
 *    the stale version. This class then implements [Cs2Context] by delegation so
 *    it can be handed to the dispatcher directly.
 *  - What *is* stale after a reload is host-side state a previous run created:
 *    hooks a script bound with `IF_SETON*` stay bound to whatever they were bound
 *    to. Those are script *ids*, resolved per dispatch, so they still point at the
 *    new bytecode; but if the edit changed which hooks get bound, the old
 *    bindings survive until the interface is reset. [onReload] exists for the
 *    viewer to do that.
 *
 * Threading: the watcher thread reads files, compiles and installs; the render
 * thread drains [poll]/[drainInto] once per frame. The state crossing that
 * boundary is the event queue (concurrent), the log (guarded by a monitor held
 * only for the append and the snapshot, never across a compile), the analyzer's
 * override map (concurrent), and [autoReload] (volatile).
